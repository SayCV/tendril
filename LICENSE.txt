LICENSING ROADMAP
-----------------

Koala sources are distributed under the terms of the "Dominant License",
i.e. AGPLv3+, unless otherwise specified withing individual source files.
This license is chosen so as to remain compliant with the licenses of the
various open source dependencies of Koala.

Over time, it is intended to refactor and release selected sections of
Koala under a more permissive license. This refactoring and re-licensing
is proposed to be based on the following considerations, and tentatively
under the listed licenses (in decreasing order of priority) :

* Sections of code necessary for customizing reports, branding, formatting,
and consequently enhancing integration with pre-existing Processes. (MIT)

* Sections of code which are easily decoupled from the Koala core and have
clear applications independent of Koala. (LGPL)

* Sections of code forming an 'API' that can be used to better integrate
Koala functionality with other Software or Infrastructure elements. (LGPL)

* Sections of code forming an 'API' that can be used to extend Koala
functionality in ways which are not of interest to the Koala core. (LGPL)

* Sections of code clearly unencumbered by upstream licensing concerns. (GPL)
